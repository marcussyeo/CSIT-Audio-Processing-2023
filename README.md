## Overview
The CSIT Data Science Mini Challenge is a unique event that aims to create awareness on the various tech focus areas of CSIT.

## The Challenge

Getting ready for Christmas, Santa checked his mailbox every day to collect wish lists. To his surprise, he found a gift for himself â€“ a rusty old audio recorder with some mysterious audio files. Now, as a talented data scientist, you've been asked to join a special team called the Decipherers of Audio Transmissions and Acoustics (DATA) Task Force. Your job is to figure out what secret messages are hidden in those audio files. Can you help Santa solve this Christmas mystery?

## Acquired Skills

In the course of this project, I have gained proficiency in several key areas:

- Utilizing **Librosa** for effective preprocessing of audio files.
- Modifying sound arrays to achieve speed variations.
- Employing data visualization techniques such as **Waveplots** and **Spectrograms** for insightful analysis.
- Developing the ability to interpret audio information visually.
- Applying **Fourier Transform** for signal processing tasks.
- Employing signal filtering techniques, including **Windowing** and **Short-Time Fourier Transforms**.
- Integrating OpenAI's **Whisper AI** for accurate speech-to-text transcription capabilities.
